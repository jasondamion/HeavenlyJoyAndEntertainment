                                    take approximately 30 minutes. Guests are then brought out onto the
                                    dance floor where they engage in a glow in dark dance party. Children are
                                    then invited to our banquet style dining table where they share some words
                                    for the birthday child and then re-energize with some pizza and juice. The
                                    festivities continue with some high energy games which our clients will
                                    choose beforehand. The night culminates with a cake cutting ceremony
                                    and pictures that will last a lifetime.</h3>

                                these three hour parties usually have a guest list of 60 guests, we like to
                                start off the party with some finger foods and by inviting guests to take
                                advantage of our digital photo booth. We then kick off the night with an ice
                                breaker or two that will encourage guests to socialize with one another.
                                Afterwards, the guest of honor usually delivers a speech and guests enjoy
                                their dinner while a slideshow is projected on our screen. After dinner, its
                                all fun and games with our competitive tournaments that will fill the venue
                                with the energy every heavenly celebration needs.</h3>
